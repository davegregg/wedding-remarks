    <p>Please, silence your phones as we begin. Also, please turn off your digital cameras and refrain from taking photos during the ceremony.</p>

    <br><strong>Please take your seats.</strong></p>

    <p>[[Wait for guests to settle.]]</p>

    <p>In fiction and poetry, the concept of Wilderness has come to represent ideas which seem contradictory to each other, and yet symbolize a great deal about life. </p>

    <p>I invite you to conjure in your mind's eye, the image you might see if you were standing before a great forest – and I promise I'm going somewhere with this – a forest of immense and sometimes strange trees... and a path which leads you forward and deep into the unknown. </p>

    <p>Entertain this poetic exercise and pause with me for just a moment to imagine and appreciate the great wilderness. </p>

    <p>[[Pause.]] </p>

    <p>Imagine the sensations — the leaves, the groans of creaking age-old trees, the sounds of unknown creatures echoing in the distance — and imagine the emotions which you might feel in that moment just at the lip of the wilderness, as your feet begin to carry you in. </p>

    <p>On the one hand, Wilderness represents uncertainty, but on the other, the joys of exploration and discovery. </p>

    <p>On the one hand, Wilderness represents the risk of danger, traps laid in bogs, spiders' webs, and creatures of fantastic form, but on the other, it represents adventure and treasure and the best of stories. </p>

    <p>Most of all, the poetic concept of Wilderness represents the dualities of life. Wilderness is a persistent metaphor for the human journey through time. </p>

    <p>We journey together on the meandering paths of life in all different ways, in friendships and family love, in messy or amiable acquaintances, and even in fleeting encounters with strangers. </p>

    <p>But most desirable to every adventurer is the depth of partnership, friendship, and intimacy which is the challenge and goal of marriage. </p>

    <p>In marriage, I give my hands to you and you give your hands to me. And hand-in-hand, we walk together in the wilderness and run together on the paths we've chosen. </p>

    <p>And with our hands, we fight together, work together, lift each other, and wipe each others' tears. Between our hands, we make a welcoming space into which we can run for comfort and safety. </p>

    <p>And it is with our hands, that we pluck the spiders' webs from each other's hair in the simplest gestures of care.</p>
    
    <p>Even when our egos are stubborn, when the forest grows dark and chill around the camp, we roll to the middle and with our hands, we reach for each other. </p>

    <p>This is the challenge and the goal of marriage. </p>

    <p>Today, we celebrate two of our beautiful friends, Virginia and Patrick, as they bring their hands together to unite their journeys and face together all the dualities of life. </p>

    <p>[[Pause.]]</p>

    <p>Patrick, Virginia, we love you. We're proud of you. We are excited for your journey. </p>

    <p>Are you, Patrick, prepared to give your vows to Virginia? </p>

    <p>[[Patrick answers.]]</p>

    <p>And are you, Virginia, prepared to give your vows to Patrick? </p>

    <p>[[Virginia answers.]]</p>

    <p>Today, we will observe the ancient ceremony of handfasting. This ritual has been performed for thousands of years as a way to symbolize the binding of two people together as a new family. </p>

    <p>[To the couple:] <strong>Please join hands.</strong>
    <br>[[Display cord.]]
    </p>

    <p>These cords symbolize the ties that bind you together – your love, your partnership, and your shared future. As these cords are bound around your hands, may you be reminded that your lives are now intertwined.</p>

    <p>[[Set aside script. Tie the couple's hands and rest your hand on the top.]]</p>
    
    <p><strong>With your free hand, you may now pull the ends of the cord to tie the knot!</strong></p>

    [[Clap.]]

    <p>[RING EXCHANGE:]
    <br>A ring is an unbroken circle, with ends that have been joined together. It represents your union and symbolizes a mutual exchange where we carry a part of each other with us every time we venture along into the world. </p>

    <p>Patrick, present Virginia with your ring:</p>

    <p>[[Wait for Patrick to be ready.]]</p>

    <p>Repeat after me: "Virginia, I give you this ring as a symbol [[pause]]<br> of my love and commitment [[pause]]<br> with a pledge: [[pause]]<br> to make the small decisions [[pause]]<br> and the large decisions [[pause]]<br> and the hard decisions [[pause]]<br> to love you today, tomorrow, always, forever."</p>

    <p>And now... Virginia, present Patrick with your ring on Patrick's finger.</p>

    <p>[[Wait for Virginia to be ready.]]</p>

    <p>Repeat after me: "Patrick, I give you this ring as a symbol [[pause]]<br> of my love and commitment [[pause]]<br> with a pledge: [[pause]]<br> to make the small decisions [[pause]]<br> and the large decisions [[pause]]<br> and the hard decisions [[pause]]<br> to love you today, tomorrow, always, forever."</p>
    
    <p><strong>All rise!</strong></p>

    <p>Family and friends, I am very proud, and not a little ecstatic, to present to you, <strong>Mr. and Mrs. Knapczek-Shannon</strong>! Patrick, you may now kiss the bride!</p>

    <p>[[Clap.]]</p>

    <p>[Recessional music begins.]
    <br>[Couple recedes to the rear.]
    <br>[Wedding party recedes to exit.]</p>

    <p>Parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins, please be seated... and remain here for photos and some personal time with the happy couple while the rest of you, greet the happy couple on your way to the tent for a cocktail hour! We bid you to enjoy your evening!</p>
