    <h1>Austin & Michelle Wedding Script (September 2023)</h1>

    <p>Hello everyone, my name is David. I'll be officiating today.</p>

    <p>Please find your seats before the ceremony begins.</p>

    <p>Please turn off or silence your phones at this time. Rest assured that the photographer will capture the unforgettable moments. The music will signal the procession.</p>

    <p>Thank you!</p>

    <p>[[<em>Music begins: All rise!</em>]]</p>

    <p>[[<em>Places taken</em>]]</p>

    <p>Thank you all for coming. You may be seated.</p>

    <p>We are here to celebrate Michelle and Austin taking the next step in their journey together. This day is about sharing the love they have for each other; it symbolizes the beginning of a new chapter for their future. It’s my privilege to make things official and lead the ceremony today.</p>

    <p>Michelle and Austin wrote their vows, which they will read aloud to each other.</p>

    <p>[[<em>Michelle goes first, then Austin</em>]]</p>

    <p>You may retrieve the rings.</p>

    <p>[[<em>wait</em>]]</p>

    <p>Austin, repeat after me – I give you this ring... to remind you of this day... that we vowed... our love will overcome all things... and that our love... unites and inspires us... and will continue to do so... for the rest of our lives.</p>

    <p>[[<em>Ring #1 placed</em>]]</p>

    <p>Austin, do you take Michelle as your wife?</p>

    <p>[[<em>I do</em>]]</p>

    <p>Michelle, repeat after me – I give you this ring... to remind you of this day... that we vowed... our love will overcome all things... and that our love... unites and inspires us... and will continue to do so... for the rest of our lives.</p>

    <p>[[<em>Ring #2 placed</em>]]</p>

    <p>Michelle, do you take Austin as your husband?</p>

    <p>[[<em>I do</em>]]</p>

    <p>It is my honor and my pleasure to pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss!</p>

    <p>[[<em>Cue Music: All rise!</em>]]</p>

    <p>[[Afterwards:]]</p>

    <p>Now, we will move the chairs over to the tent and enjoy a cocktail hour while Austin and Michelle take photos with the bridal party. Please ask those around you if you need assistance. The DJ will then introduce the Bride and Groom before releasing tables for dinner. Thank you once again!</p>
