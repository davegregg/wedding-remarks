    <h1>Randy & Lainey Wedding Script (June 2023)</h1>

    <p>[[After the song "Moon River" concludes:]]</p>

    <p>Welcome, friends and family of Lainey Bell and Randy Pears. Please, silence your phones as we begin — and enjoy the wonderful music played by Ellen and Emily.</p>

    <p>[[When Lainey is ready to walk down the aisle, to guests:]]
    <br><strong>All rise!</strong></p> 

    <p>[[Wait for procession. Lainey and Randy will stand before me:]]
    <br><strong>Please take your seats.</strong></p>

    <p>[[Wait for guests to settle.]]</p>

    <p>In fiction and poetry, the concept of Wilderness has come to represent ideas which seem contradictory to each other, and yet symbolize a great deal about life.</p>

    <p>I invite you to conjure in your mind's eye, the image of standing before a forest – and I promise I'm going somewhere with this – a forest of immense and sometimes strange trees and a path which leads you forward and deep into the unknown.</p>

    <p>Entertain this poetic exercise and pause for just a moment to imagine the wilderness before you embark again on that path at the conclusion of our ceremonies.</p>

    <p>Imagine the sensations — the leaves, the groans of creaking age-old trees, the sounds of unknown creatures echoing in the distance — and imagine the emotions which you might feel in that moment just at the lip of the wilderness, as your feet begin to carry you in.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, Wilderness represents uncertainty, but on the other, the joys of exploration and discovery.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, Wilderness represents the risk of danger, traps laid in bogs, creatures, and spiders' webs, but on the other, it represents adventure and treasure and the best of stories. </p>

    <p>Most of all, Wilderness represents the dualities of life. Wilderness is a persistent metaphor for our journey through time. </p>

    <p>We journey together on the meandering paths of life in all different ways in friendships and family love and messy or amiable acquaintances and even brief encounters with strangers. </p>

    <p>But most desirable to every adventurer is the depth of partnership, friendship, and intimacy which is the goal of marriage. </p>

    <p>In marriage, I give my hands to you and you give your hands to me. And hand-in-hand, we walk together in the wilderness and run together on the paths we've chosen. </p>

    <p>And with our hands, we fight together and work together. And we make a safe space between our arms and wipe each others' tears. </p>

    <p>And we pluck the spiders' webs from each other's hair. And even when our egos are stubborn, when the forest grows dark and chill around the camp, we roll to the middle and reach for each other. </p>

    <p>This is marriage. </p>

    <p>And today, we celebrate the marriage of two of our good friends, Lainey-Bell and Randy, as they journey together and face together all the dualities of life.</p>

    <p>[[Slight pause]]</p>

    <p>At this time, I'd like to invite a friend, Elaine, to read a passage from Wilferd Arlan Peterson's poem, "The Art of the Marriage," selected by the happy couple.</p>

    <p>[[Elaine gives reading: "...being the right partner."]]</p>

    <p>Randy, Lainey, we love you. We're proud of you. We are excited for your mutual journey.</p>

    <p>Do you, Randy, take Lainey to be your lawfully wedded wife? To have and to hold, in sickness and in health, in good times and not so good times, for richer or poorer for as long as you both shall live?</p>

    <p>[[Randy answers]]</p>

    <p>And do you, Lainey, take Randy to be your lawfully wedded husband? To have and to hold, in sickness and in health, in good times and not so good times, for richer or poorer for as long as you both shall live?</p>

    <p>[[Lainey answers]]</p>

    <p>[[RING EXCHANGE:]]
    <br>A ring is an unbroken circle, with ends that have been joined together, and it represents your union. It is a symbol of infinity, and of your infinite love. When you look at these rings on your hands, be reminded of this moment, your commitment, and the love you now feel for each other.</p>

    <p>Randy, place the ring on Lainey's finger and repeat after me:</p>

    <p>[[Wait for Randy to be ready]]</p>

    <p>"Lainey, I give you this ring as a symbol of my love with a pledge: [[pause]] to love you today, tomorrow, always, and forever."</p>

    <p>[[Randy repeats.]]</p>

    <p>And now... Lainey, place the ring on Randy's finger and repeat after me:</p>

    <p>[[Wait for Lainey to be ready]]</p>

    <p>"Randy, I give you this ring as a symbol of my love with a pledge: [[pause]] to love you today, tomorrow, always, and forever."</p>

    <p>[[Lainey repeats.]]</p>

    <p>To my left are two containers of sand. Please step before them.</p>

    <p>[[Wait for them to relocate.]]</p>

    <p>That container of sand represents you – all that you were, all that you are, and all that you will ever be.  And today you are combining all of you and your uniqueness into the final vessel.  And just as these grains of sand can no longer be separated into their individual containers again, so shall your marriage and your lives forever be intertwined.</p>

    <p>[[Randy and Lainey perform sand ceremony.]]</p>

    <p>[[They will return to their original positions before me.]]</p>

    <p>Randy Pares and Lainey Bell, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Randy, you may now kiss the bride.</p>

    <p>[[To guests:]] <strong>All rise!</strong></p>

    <p>[[After exit procession has completed (including family), announce:]]</p>

    <p>Friends, family, and guests, we invite you to enjoy cocktail hour inside just up these steps to my right.</p>
